React App Bootstrap CLI Script

This is a script that runs through the process of bootstraping a react app with parcel, eslint "airbnb" and prettier.

It can be quite challenging to git all these things setup and working together, this project makes it a single command.

## Install 

```
npm install @twilson63/mkapp
```

## Usage

```
mkapp [appname]
```

## About 

Using shelljs this is a basic bash script, but should work on all platforms with nodejs installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but only around bootstraping react, eslint and prettier, don't want to add too many opinions to the setup as they are more likely to change over time.
